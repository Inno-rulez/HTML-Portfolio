<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Innocent—a passionate educator, programmer, and lifelong learner based in South Africa. With a strong 
  foundation in engineering mechanics and C++ programming, I thrive at the intersection of teaching and technology. 
  Whether I’m guiding students through complex concepts or crafting efficient solutions in Python and C++, my goal is 
  to simplify the complex and inspire curiosity.</p>

<p>I’ve also worked as an assistant mechanic and junior technician, specializing in electronics. This experience has 
  given me a practical understanding of systems and troubleshooting, which I bring into my work. My hands-on 
  expertise with tools like LTspice, Simulink, and raylib complements my technical skill set, ensuring effective and 
  innovative problem-solving. I’m currently exploring the use of animations to make abstract concepts even more dynamic 
  and engaging.</p>

<p>When I’m not tutoring or coding, you’ll find me enjoying my favorite games like <em>Once Human</em> or <em>Euro Truck 
  Simulator 2</em>. I also love tackling creative challenges, such as designing maze projects or automating tasks with 
  Python scripts. Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out—I’d love to collaborate or help you unlock your 
  potential!</p>
